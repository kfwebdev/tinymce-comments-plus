# tinymce-comments-plus
WordPress plugin to enhance comments with the TinyMCE Editor, Inline Comment Editing and Asynchronous Posting.

## FAQ
Why are there two edit buttons on my comments?
WordPress adds it's own Edit link when logged in with Administrator privileges. Subscriber level users won't see the Administrator Edit links.

Why are the Edit, Submit and Cancel buttons positioned weird and not fitting my theme?
To customize the look and behavior of the buttons you'll need to assign your own custom CSS classes to them in the settings.
